    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;


    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // team[3] = 'Princess'

    // however what happens when we update that array?

        // team = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Princess"]
        // players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Princess"]

      //Here we se that team is not its own array, but a reference to the original players array
      // **TEAMS is NOT a copy of players

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way

    // The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new
    // array object selected from begin to end (end not included). The original array
    // will not be modified. [From MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice]
    const team2 = players.slice() // passing the slice method nothing will give you a copy fo the entire array


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);


    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };


    // and think we make a copy:

    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 100;

    // how do we take a copy instead? Use Object.assign
    // 1 - start with a blank object
    // 2 - pass the object you wish to copy the properties form (i.e. person)
    // 3 - then add in properties you wish to overwrite
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 100, age: 100025600 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread (not yet available)

    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);

    // cloning an object
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); // In this case the social object will be a refererence of the original object, not a clone

    // 'poor mans' solution to cloning an obj
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
